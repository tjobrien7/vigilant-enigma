# X-Team 66 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

We will try to collaborate and work at the same time if possible but apart from that we will distribute the work such that
each team member is able to work on parts of the program where they feel they would learn the most. 

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

We will be in communication about where we are at over Facebook Messenger and set deadlines for tasks.

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

We'll use Facebook messager to communicate about any problems or difficulties, and ask for help if we need it. We can also meet in person if that's necessary to solve the problem.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

In the case that any difficulties do arise, we will offer assistance and possibly reassign tasks to ensure that deadlines are met. We will also meet and begin working on tasks well before assignments are due so that we do not run out of time before the deadline.

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
